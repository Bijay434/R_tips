# Introduction

The second part of my tutorial series about SQL to R workflows is mainly
focused on breaking down differences between SQL and R syntax. It also
contains a rehash of Emily Riedererâ€™s excellent [blog
post](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/sql-r-flow/) on designing
flexible workflows for SQL to R projects. We will be using the SQL
database(s) we set up in the [first
tutorial](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips/blob/master/tutorials/p-sql_to_r_workflows/p-sql_to_r_workflows_part_1.md)
for the exercises below.

``` r
# Create MS SQL connection -----------------------------------------------------
tsql_conn <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                            Driver = "SQL Server Native Client 11.0",
                            Server = "localhost",
                            Database = "sandpit",
                            Trusted_Connection = "Yes")
```

# SQL syntax quirks

In my opinion, the easiest way of learning SQL code is to remember the
sequence of how SQL code is executed. In R, because we can chain
multiple operations together, the sequence in which R code is written is
usually identical to the sequence in which it is executed.

<img src="../../figures/p-sql_to_r_workflows-execution_order.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In SQL, the sequence in which SQL code is written does not correspond to
the sequence in which it is executed, which leads to common errors like
the example below.

``` r
# Incorrect SQL query ----------------------------------------------------------
# odbc::dbSendQuery(
#   tsql_conn,
#   "
#   SELECT 
#   student_id AS hobbit_id,
#   first_name, 
#   last_name
#   
#   FROM education.student
#   WHERE hobbit_id <> 2
#   
#   -- this query will generate an error as WHERE is executed before SELECT and
#   -- the renaming of student_id to hobbit_id only happens via SELECT 
#   "
# ) 

# Correct SQL query ------------------------------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  SELECT
  student_id AS hobbit_id,
  first_name, 
  last_name
  
  FROM education.student
  WHERE student_id <> 2
  
  -- student_id is first filtered via WHERE and then renamed as hobbit_id via SELECT
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| hobbit\_id | first\_name | last\_name |
|-----------:|:------------|:-----------|
|          1 | Frodo       | Baggins    |
|          3 | Merry       | Brandybuck |
|          4 | Peregrin    | Took       |

## Writing SQL `JOIN` queries

The `dplyr` syntax for joining tables is very similar to its
corresponding SQL syntax. The concept of left joins, right joins, inner
joins and full joins are shared across both languages. In SQL, `JOIN` is
executed directly after `FROM` and it is best practice to aliasing
(rename via `AS`) table names to specify the records to join.

**Note:** Always ensure that you are joining to at least one column
containing unique Ids to prevent unexpected many-to-many joined results.

``` r
# Perform inner join using SQL query -------------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  SELECT
  c.course_name,
  c.course_desc,
  p.platform_name,
  p.company_name
  
  FROM education.course AS c
  INNER JOIN education.platform AS p
    ON c.platform_id = p.platform_id
  
  WHERE is_active = 1 OR is_active IS NULL
  
  -- select course name and description and their corresponding platform and
  -- company name for platforms that are active or NULL for is_active 
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| course\_name                      | course\_desc                                                               | platform\_name  | company\_name |
|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| See shiny orbs                    | 5/5 experience! Just ask the wisest wizard Saruman                         | Seeing Wise     | Palantir Inc  |
| Breakfast pies                    | Savoury pies and sweet pies for breakfast and second breakfast             | Jolly Bakers    | Shire School  |
| Emergency dwarven bread           | Bake these goods to politely send unexpected guests off on their way again | Jolly Bakers    | Shire School  |
| Growing vegetable pie ingredients | All good hobbits should know that vegetable pies cannot be vegetarian      | Happy Gardeners | Shire School  |
| Growing flowers                   | Hobbits should not just grow plants for eating!                            | Happy Gardeners | Shire School  |

The equivalent R `dplyr` syntax follows the execution order, rather than
written order, of the SQL join query.

**Note:** When using `dbplyr`, the education schema needs to explicitly
passed using the function `in_schema("schema", "table")` inside `tbl()`.

``` r
# Perform inner join using R syntax --------------------------------------------
tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "course")) %>%
  inner_join(tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "platform")),
             by = c("platform_id" = "platform_id")) %>%
  filter(is_active == 1 | is.na(is_active)) %>%
  select(course_name,
         course_desc,
         platform_name,
         company_name) %>%
  collect() 
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 4
    ##   course_name         course_desc                     platform_name company_name
    ##   <chr>               <chr>                           <chr>         <chr>

    ## 4 Growing vegetable ~ All good hobbits should know t~ Happy Garden~ Shire School
    ## 5 Growing flowers     Hobbits should not just grow p~ Happy Garden~ Shire School

## Writing SQL `GROUP BY` queries

In SQL, grouping by column(s) causes individual records to be grouped
together as record tuples. Because SQL queries return atomic records,
this is why `SELECT` can only be performed on the group by column(s) and
aggregations of other columns.

``` r
# Incorrect SQL query ----------------------------------------------------------
# odbc::dbSendQuery(
#   tsql_conn,
#   "
#   SELECT
#   p.platform_name,
#   COUNT(course_id) as total_courses,
#   c.course_id
#   
#   FROM education.course AS c
#   INNER JOIN education.platform AS p
#     ON c.platform_id = p.platform_id
#   
#   GROUP BY p.platform_id, p.platform_name
#   
#   -- this query will generate an error as course_id is no longer an atomic 
#   -- record once grouped by platform_id and platform_name 
#   "
# )
```

In SQL, `WHERE` and `HAVING` are separate filtering methods as `WHERE`
is executed first across individual records, before the `GROUP BY`
statement. `HAVING` is executed after `GROUP BY` to enable filtering
across individual grouped records and therefore requires an aggregation
as its input.

As `SELECT` is executed last, this also means that the `SELECT`
statement can only refer to the column(s) being grouped and aggregations
of other columns.

``` r
# Perform group by and aggregate SQL query -------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  SELECT
  p.platform_id, 
  p.platform_name,
  COUNT(course_id) as total_courses,
  AVG(course_length) AS avg_course_length, 
  MIN(course_length) AS min_course_length,
  MAX(course_length) AS max_course_length
  
  FROM education.course AS c
  INNER JOIN education.platform AS p
    ON c.platform_id = p.platform_id
  
  WHERE course_length IS NOT NULL
  
  GROUP BY p.platform_id, p.platform_name
  
  HAVING COUNT(course_id) > 1
  
  -- join course and platform tables, filter out courses without a course length
  -- and then group records by platform_id and platform_name 
  -- filter to exclude platforms which only have one course
  -- finally select plaform name, total course count, average course length, min
  -- course length and max course length   
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| platform\_id | platform\_name  | total\_courses | avg\_course\_length | min\_course\_length | max\_course\_length |
|-------------:|:----------------|---------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|
|            1 | Happy Gardeners |              2 |                  62 |                  35 |                  90 |
|            2 | Jolly Bakers    |              2 |                   5 |                   1 |                  10 |

The equivalent R `dplyr` syntax uses `filter()` before and after
`group_by()` and aggregations are performed inside `summarise()`.

``` r
# Perform group by and aggregate using R syntax --------------------------------
tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "course")) %>%
  inner_join(tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "platform")),
             by = c("platform_id" = "platform_id")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(course_length)) %>%
  group_by(platform_id, platform_name) %>%
  summarise(total_courses = n_distinct(course_id),
            avg_course_length = mean(course_length),
            min_course_length = min(course_length),
            max_course_length = max(course_length)) %>%
  filter(total_courses > 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  collect()  
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'platform_id'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 6
    ##   platform_id platform_name   total_courses avg_course_length min_course_length
    ##         <int> <chr>                   <int>             <int>             <int>
    ## 1           1 Happy Gardeners             2                62                35
    ## 2           2 Jolly Bakers                2                 5                 1
    ## # ... with 1 more variable: max_course_length <int>

## Writing SQL `WINDOW` functions

In SQL, `SELECT` statements can only reference columns in the same row
as each other, i.e.Â referencing two columns to concatenate their
contents together. `WINDOW` functions are used when we need to refer to
a record that is in a different row to our selected record. `WINDOW`
functions comprise of an operation `OVER` a window of records designated
using a `PARTITION BY` statement.

``` r
# Perform window over SQL query ------------------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  SELECT
  student_id, 
  start_date,
  end_date, 
  LAG(end_date) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id ORDER BY start_date ASC)
    AS last_end_date, 
  DATEDIFF(day,
           LAG(end_date) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id ORDER BY start_date ASC),
           start_date) 
    AS days_since_last_course
  
  FROM education.enrolment
  
  WHERE student_id IN (1, 2) 
  
  -- filter to keep records where student_id = 1 or student_id = 2  
  -- select student_id, start_date, the end_date lag calculated over a window
  -- partitioned by student_id and sorted by ascending start_date and the date
  -- difference (in days) between the start_date and end_date lag   
  
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| student\_id | start\_date | end\_date  | last\_end\_date | days\_since\_last\_course |
|------------:|:------------|:-----------|:----------------|--------------------------:|
|           1 | 2000-02-01  | 2000-04-10 | NA              |                        NA |

|           2 | 2005-03-01  | 2005-07-30 | 2001-07-30      |                      1310 |

In R, window functions are performed using `group_by()` and `arrange()`
and followed by `mutate()` operations. These operations are not
supported by the `dbplyr` API, but can be executed if you first collect
the entire table as an R data frame and then apply transformations using
`dplyr` functions.

``` r
# Perform window over in R syntax ----------------------------------------------
# Using the dbplyr API generates an error message
# tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "enrolment")) %>%
#   filter(student_id %in% c(1, 2)) %>%
#   group_by(student_id) %>%
#   arrange(student_id, start_date) %>% 
#   mutate(last_end_date = lag(end_date),
#          days_since_last_course = difftime(start_date, last_end_date, "days")) %>%
#   select(student_id, 
#          start_date,
#          end_date,
#          last_end_date,
#          days_since_last_course) %>%
#   ungroup() %>% 
#   collect()

# Collect the SQL table as an R data frame and use dplyr functions -------------
tbl(tsql_conn, in_schema("education", "enrolment")) %>%
  collect %>% 
  filter(student_id %in% c(1, 2)) %>%
  group_by(student_id) %>%
  arrange(student_id, start_date) %>% 
  mutate(last_end_date = lag(end_date),
         days_since_last_course = difftime(start_date, last_end_date, "days")) %>%
  select(student_id, 
         start_date,
         end_date,
         last_end_date,
         days_since_last_course) %>%
  ungroup()

Regardless of whether you are using SQL or R, window operations are more
computationally expensive than other operations, as a separate window of
records needs to be generated and selected from for each record.

## Writing SQL subqueries and common table expressions

In R, we can create and store multiple data frames in memory and
reference them for data analysis at any time. In SQL, we need to rely on
subqueries or common table expressions to produce data outputs which
cannot be answered using a single SQL query.

The code below will generate an error as enrolment records are stored
inside tuples following `GROUP BY student_id` and therefore cannot be
individually retrieved.

``` r
# Incorrect SQL query ----------------------------------------------------------
# odbc::dbSendQuery(
#   tsql_conn,
#   "
#   SELECT 
#   student_id,
#   enrolment_id,
#   course_id,
#   start_date,
#   end_date
#   
#   FROM education.enrolment
#   
#   GROUP BY student_id
#   HAVING min(start_date) > '2005-01-01'
#   "
# )
```

Instead, a subquery to first extract the `student_id` of students who
enrolled in their first course after 2005-01-01 is then used to query
individual enrolment records.

``` r
# Perform SQL subquery ---------------------------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  SELECT 
  student_id,
  enrolment_id,
  course_id,
  start_date,
  end_date
  
  FROM education.enrolment
  
  WHERE student_id IN (
    SELECT 
    student_id
    FROM education.enrolment
    GROUP BY student_id
    HAVING min(start_date) > '2005-01-01'
  )
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| student\_id | enrolment\_id | course\_id | start\_date | end\_date  |
|------------:|--------------:|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
|           3 |             9 | SB01       | 2008-08-01  | 2008-08-02 |
|           4 |            10 | SG01       | 2008-03-01  | 2008-03-03 |
|           4 |            11 | MORDOR666  | 2022-07-13  | NA         |

Common table expressions (CTEs) allow you to rename individual
subqueries and are a more readable alternative for integrating SQL
subqueries.

``` r
# Rewrite SQL subquery as CTE --------------------------------------------------
odbc::dbSendQuery(
  tsql_conn,
  "
  WITH recent_students as (
    SELECT 
    student_id
    FROM education.enrolment
    GROUP BY student_id
    HAVING min(start_date) > '2005-01-01'
  )
  
  SELECT 
  e.student_id,
  e.enrolment_id,
  e.course_id,
  e.start_date,
  e.end_date
  
  FROM education.enrolment AS e
  INNER JOIN recent_students
  ON e.student_id = recent_students.student_id
  "
) %>%
  odbc::dbFetch() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| student\_id | enrolment\_id | course\_id | start\_date | end\_date  |
|------------:|--------------:|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|
|           3 |             9 | SB01       | 2008-08-01  | 2008-08-02 |
